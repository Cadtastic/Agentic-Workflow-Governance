## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-09

Adds the Stop-Gate Decision Model — the framework's normative answer to *when and when not* to use human stop gates — and corrects/broadens the §0 evidence base. Driven by REVIEW-v0.3.md (strategic review against the June 2026 landscape, with adversarial source verification). Canonical spec renamed to `SPEC.md`; prior snapshots moved to `spec-history/`. Completes the v0.4 scope: data-sensitivity fifth axis, stable identifiers, governance-grade identity precondition, threat-model appendix, and strengthened multi-agent coverage.

### Added

- **§5.4 Stop-Gate Decision Model.** Human gates now carry a justification burden:
  - **§5.4.1 Placement test.** A `human-attestation` gate is justified only if all five conditions hold — G1 competence advantage, G2 epistemic access, G3 causal power, G4 attention budget, G5 leverage point — each with a named substitute control on failure. Recorded per-gate at `design-attestation`.
  - **§5.4.2 Selective gating as default shape (YELLOW+).** The gate fires on uncertainty-threshold breach, irreversibility, scope-bound approach, or plan deviation — not per-action. Set-based/conformal uncertainty signals preferred over raw confidence scalars.
  - **§5.4.3 Granularity parameter.** `human-attestation(n, sod, granularity: plan | action | batch)`. Plan-level attestation approves the plan at the Plan→Act boundary; the approved plan becomes a `scope-bound-execution` contract; deviation re-gates.
  - **§5.4.4 Gate-health monitoring (required).** `drift-monitor` MUST track approval rate (sustained ≥ ~95–98% = presumptively dead gate → mandatory redesign with three sanctioned outcomes), review latency distribution, and (RED, recommended) seeded-error catch rate. "Leave it as is" is not a sanctioned outcome.
  - **§5.4.5 Anti-patterns.** Dead gate kept for show; blame-record gate; uniform per-action gating "to be safe"; the unfalsifiable gate.
- **§6.2 / §6.5 infrastructure-asserted evidence.** `evidence` and `diff` must be produced by systems the agent does not control; new anti-pattern *agent-narrated evidence*. Threat basis: goal hijacking (OWASP ASI01) and demonstrated approval-prompt misrepresentation attacks.
- **Glossary entries (Appendix A).** *Dead gate*, *gate-health*, *placement test*, *selective gating*.
- **CITATION.cff** with ORCID, enabling Zenodo DOI-per-release archiving and ORCID auto-update.
- **§3.5 Data sensitivity — fifth classification axis (ratified).** None-or-internal → GREEN; Regulated → ≥YELLOW; Special-category (PHI, credentials/secrets, biometric, children's data) → ≥RED. New `data_signal` in the §3.1 algorithm; new §3.2 stacking rule; §3.4 worked examples re-scored with a Data column (credential rotation now stacks two RED triggers).
- **Stable identifiers.** Primitives `AWG-P01`–`AWG-P10`, composition patterns `AWG-C01`–`AWG-C06`. Permanent — never renumbered or reused — so external tooling, crosswalks, and audits can reference them across versions (§5.0).
- **§5.0 Cross-cutting precondition: governance-grade agent identity.** Platform-issued, distinct per agent, lifecycle-managed, verifiable at every gate; shared service accounts declared non-governance-grade. A precondition of the primitive library, not an eleventh primitive.
- **Appendix D — Threat Model & Trust Boundaries.** Platform-enforced preconditions; infrastructure-asserted vs. agent-asserted schema field classification; adversarial behaviors the structure addresses (goal hijacking, approval-prompt misrepresentation, provenance evasion, authority persistence); explicit out-of-scope list with pointers to OWASP ASI and MAESTRO.
- **§2 L0 caveat.** Automation bias operates at L0 too; named as a model-risk concern, not an agentic-governance one.

### Changed

- **§0 rewritten.** Wiles et al. (2026) now characterized precisely: full-sample average effects are small; the 16%/44% headline numbers are pre-registered subgroup effects among the ~23% of orgs that list AI agents on org charts; working-paper status and framing-experiment design stated. Evidence base broadened: Vaccaro, Almaatouq & Malone (2024) meta-analysis; Green & Chen (2019); Green (2022); production approval-rate data (93%). *Oversight theater* named as a co-equal failure mode alongside oversight erosion.
- **§3.3 Borderline resolution.** Upward bias re-scoped: it applies to the *tier*, not to gate count. Human gates implied by a higher tier still route through the §5.4.1 placement test.
- **§5.1 `human-attestation`.** Signature gains the `granularity` parameter; structural requirements now require a recorded placement-test justification and gate-health monitoring.
- **§8 Matrix.** Human-attestation entries are minimums conditional on the placement test, with documented substitution on failure. YELLOW × Release changed from unconditional `human-attestation(n=1)` to selective, plan-or-batch granularity.
- **Spec file layout.** `agentic-workflow-governance-v0.3-skeleton.md` → `SPEC.md` (canonical, reflects HEAD); v0.1/v0.2 snapshots → `spec-history/`. Header cleaned: license set to CC BY-SA 4.0; per-version change blocks now live only in this file.
- **References (Appendix B).** Added Vaccaro et al. (2024), Green & Chen (2019), Green (2022), Sterz et al. (2024), Ren et al. (2023, KnowNo), Anthropic (2026), OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications.

### Resolved (open design questions)

- **§10 #1 (data sensitivity)** — resolved: ratified as a distinct fifth axis (§3.0, §3.5) rather than absorbed into Stakes; rationale: audit-regime crosswalks key on data category, and a distinct axis makes the data question unskippable.
- **§10 #6 (multi-agent accountability)** — resolved: the workflow's single Process Owner is accountable; the supervisor pattern (AWG-C06) gains trace-context correlation, MAST failure-mode coverage, and an explicit limits note on steganographic collusion; per-agent attribution is forensic, not accountability-bearing.

### Position-strengthened (open questions with proposed v1.0 direction)

- **§10 #8 (calibration boundary)** — direction set: declaration stays required; conditioning gates on the signal at RED requires calibration evidence at `design-attestation`; set-based/conformal signals preferred (§5.4.2).
- **§10 #9 (schema prescriptiveness)** — direction set by ecosystem convergence on JSON Schema 2020-12; official AWG schema artifact planned for v0.5 per REVIEW-v0.3.md roadmap.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-11

Drills handoff schemas, tier resolution, phase model, and composition patterns to uniform depth. Adds an end-to-end worked example (agentic refund processing). Restructures the handoff specification as a machine-validatable, schema-as-contract specification.

### Added

- **Appendix C — Worked Example: Agentic Refund Processing.** End-to-end walkthrough applying AWG to a realistic agentic workflow at RED tier. Covers all six application steps from §11, includes a full YAML handoff-schema instance, and contrasts the AWG-governed workflow against a typical pre-AWG version that fails P1–P4.
- **§3.1 Resolution algorithm.** Tier resolution is now expressed deterministically: `tier = max(agency_signal, stakes_signal, reversibility_signal, blast_radius_signal)`. Each axis maps to a tier signal; the workflow tier is the maximum. Replaces v0.2's subjective tier mapping.
- **§3.2 RED-trigger stacking.** Multiple RED triggers do not compound the tier (it is already maximal) but DO compound gate intensity. Specific stacking rules for External-blast-radius RED, Irreversibility RED, High-stakes RED, and L3-agency RED.
- **§3.3 Borderline resolution.** Ambiguous axis values bias toward the higher tier. Explicit downgrade requires `design-attestation` review with documented rationale. Codifies "default is over-governed, not under-governed" as a P4 enforcement.
- **§4 phase entry/exit criteria.** Each phase (Plan, Act, Verify, Release, Monitor) now has explicit entry conditions, expected activity, exit conditions, and common gate placement. Replaces v0.2's one-line phase descriptions.
- **§4.2 phase optionality patterns.** Documents that not every workflow exercises every phase, with named patterns: read-only-inquiry (Plan only), idempotent-single-shot (Plan + Act), bulk-operations (all five), long-running-agents (continuous Monitor with nested Plan/Act).
- **§4.3 "Phase boundaries are gates."** Makes the placement principle explicit: governance lives at phase transitions; within a phase, the agent operates with the authority granted by `design-attestation` and constrained by `scope-bound-execution`.
- **§6.1 Schema-as-contract model.** Three-party contract framing — the agent (must produce schema-valid content or be blocked), the reviewer (has uniform shape to react to), the provenance log (receives the structured record).
- **§6.2 Base schema with 13 machine-validatable required fields.** `workflow_id`, `action_id`, `agent_identity`, `process_owner`, `intent`, `proposed_action`, `diff`, `justification`, `evidence`, `uncertainty`, `reversibility`, `open_questions`, `provenance_ref`. Each field has explicit type and validation rules. Replaces v0.2's prose enumeration of six fields.
- **§6.3 Tier-graded schema extensions.** YELLOW adds `alternatives_considered` (may be empty with sentinel) and `impact_assessment`. RED adds `compliance_trace`, `rehearsal_ref`, and `dual_attestation`, and requires `alternatives_considered` to have ≥1 item with rejection rationale.
- **§6.4 Schema-to-primitive mapping.** Table specifying which primitive produces, validates, and consumes each schema field. Makes the cross-section coupling between §5 and §6 explicit.
- **§6.5 Schema-specific anti-patterns.** Free-form prose handoffs, human-only validation, reviewer-judgment fields, partial schemas per tier, agent-set approval status, mutable schemas.
- **§6.6 Worked YAML schema example.** Full YELLOW-tier handoff for an "orders cancel" action, demonstrating every required and conditional field populated with realistic content.
- **§10 Q9.** New open design question: should v1.0 publish an official AWG Schema (e.g., JSON Schema artifact) for cross-adopter interoperability, or stay tool-neutral?
- **Glossary entries (Appendix A).** *RED-trigger stacking*, *schema validator*.

### Changed

- **§5.2 Composition Patterns.** Each of the six patterns (circuit-breaker, dual-control, canary-deploy, rollback-rehearsed, time-bounded-contractor, multi-agent-supervisor) now follows the same uniform schema as primitives — composes / when-to-use / structural requirements / anti-pattern. Replaces v0.2's bullet-point sketches.
- **§6 Handoff Schemas — fully restructured.** Reorganized from a prose description of required fields into a six-subsection schema-as-contract specification: design philosophy (§6.0), contract model (§6.1), base schema (§6.2), tier-graded extensions (§6.3), schema-to-primitive mapping (§6.4), anti-patterns (§6.5), worked example (§6.6). Schema validation is now framed as the *first* gate (machine-enforced) before human review.
- **§3 worked examples.** Refreshed under the v0.3 resolution algorithm. Notable shift: the Slack-channel-archival example moved from GREEN (v0.2) to YELLOW (v0.3) because L2 agency now floors the signal at YELLOW. Documented in §3.4 as a deliberate consequence of "any bounded-autonomy AI in production should at minimum have provenance logging and a kill switch."
- **§8 Matrix wording.** Cells now reference v0.3 composition patterns where appropriate (e.g., RED Monitor cell now reads "circuit-breaker pattern + `drift-monitor` + `time-to-live` (hours)" rather than enumerating constituent primitives). Reading the matrix requires §5 primitives, §5.2 patterns, and §6 schemas together. Adds a "minimum baseline" interpretation rule.

### Position-strengthened (open questions with proposed v1.0 direction)

- **§10 Q1** — *Data sensitivity as a fifth classification axis.* Proposed direction now stated: distinct fifth axis with regulated data → minimum YELLOW, special-category data (health, finance) → minimum RED. Not yet ratified.
- **§10 Q3** — *Re-classification cadence.* Proposal: annual re-attestation for all YELLOW+, semi-annual for RED, in addition to `drift-monitor`-triggered reclassification.
- **§10 Q4** — *Tooling neutrality.* Current bias documented: stay neutral; provide a reference YAML shape (§6.6) without mandating a specific validator implementation.
- **§10 Q6** — *Multi-agent workflows.* v0.3 position articulated: single Process Owner of the workflow eats the loss; supervisor pattern (§5.2) is the structural shape; per-agent attribution lives in `provenance-log` for post-hoc analysis. Whether this is sufficient remains open.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-11

A structural rework of the gate primitive library. The taxonomy now sorts primitives along a three-axis space (lifecycle / authority / function) and distinguishes atomic primitives from composition patterns. The handoff schema and AWG matrix are updated to reflect the new primitive library.

### Added

- **Composition patterns section (§5.2).** Six named patterns — circuit-breaker, dual-control, canary-deploy, rollback-rehearsed, time-bounded-contractor, multi-agent-supervisor — declared as compositions of atomic primitives rather than primitives in their own right. Each follows the same uniform schema as primitives (composes / when-to-use / structural requirements / anti-pattern).
- **Anti-patterns section (§5.3).** Catalog of gate-shaped constructs that fail Principle 4 ("cheap talk does not govern"), with the structurally enforced primitive replacement called out for each.
- **`uncertainty-declaration` primitive.** New atomic primitive requiring agents to surface a calibrated uncertainty signal as a required handoff field; downstream gate intensity may be dynamically conditioned on the value.
- **`scope-bound-execution` primitive.** Machine-enforced bounds (rate limits, dollar limits, allowed-resource lists, identity scopes) encoded in capability tokens or middleware rather than in the agent's prompt.
- **`provenance-log` primitive.** Immutable append-only record of every agent action, promoted to first-class status to serve as the substrate for accountability (P1) and the signal source for `drift-monitor` and `policy-halt`.
- **`time-to-live` primitive.** Platform-enforced expiration of agent authority; renewal requires re-attestation rather than silent continuation.
- **`drift-monitor` primitive.** Continuous comparison of agent behavior to a deployment-time baseline; significant drift halts the agent and forces reclassification through `design-attestation`.
- **`policy-halt` primitive.** Declarative, version-controlled halt-on-condition primitive enforced below the agent; resume requires fresh `human-attestation`.
- **`design-attestation` primitive.** Design-time multi-human (RED) or single-human (lower tiers) attestation that the workflow design — including gate composition, scope bounds, Process Owner, rollback procedure, idempotency analysis, TTL parameters — is approved.
- **Calibration scope boundary (§9).** Explicit clarification that AWG requires the *declaration* of uncertainty but defers calibration *evaluation* to model-risk frameworks (e.g., NIST AI RMF). Closes a structural ambiguity in v0.1.
- **Glossary entries (Appendix A).** *Atomic primitive*, *composition pattern*, *coordinate*, *provenance*.

### Changed

- **§5 (Gate Primitives) fully rewritten.** Replaced v0.1's six-item primitive list — which mixed gate types, gate parameters, pre-conditions, post-conditions, design-time prerequisites, and composed controls as if they were peers — with a three-axis primitive taxonomy:
  - **Lifecycle phase** — design-time / pre-action / mid-action / post-action / continuous
  - **Authority required** — automated / single-human / multi-human / out-of-band
  - **Function** — constrain / verify / attest / observe / halt / reverse

  Every primitive is now characterized by a coordinate in this space. The taxonomy is the framework's self-check: a "primitive" that doesn't fit cleanly is either misnamed or actually composed of smaller primitives.
- **Primitive library size: 6 → 10.** The new set is more atomic and closes gaps from v0.1 — there is now a primitive for bounded scope, for provenance, for time-bounded authority, for drift detection, and for uncertainty declaration, none of which existed in v0.1.
- **`dual-control` collapsed into `human-attestation(n, sod)`.** Dual control is now expressed as a parameter on the human-attestation primitive (`n=2, sod=true`) rather than as a primitive of its own. Reduces taxonomy noise and clarifies that "single approver" and "dual control" are points on a single parameterized primitive.
- **§6 handoff schema.** Added `uncertainty` as a required schema field to carry the `uncertainty-declaration` output into the gate review artifact. Reviewers can now condition decisions on the agent's stated confidence.
- **§8 matrix.** Cells now specify primitive coordinates (with parameters) per tier × phase rather than referencing v0.1's higher-level gate names. The matrix is no longer self-contained; reading it requires the §5 primitive library and §5.2 patterns as inputs.

### Removed

- **`dual-control` as a standalone primitive.** Replaced by `human-attestation(n=2, sod=true)`. See Changed.
- **`circuit-breaker` from the primitive library.** Moved to §5.2 composition patterns; expressed as `provenance-log` (signal source) + `policy-halt` (halt action), optionally with `drift-monitor` and/or `scope-bound-execution` as additional halt sources.
- **`rollback-rehearsed` from the primitive library.** Moved to §5.2 composition patterns; expressed as `design-attestation` carrying a rehearsal-log artifact reference, optionally combined with `observable-period`.
- **`human-review-required` and `observable-period-required` as standalone primitive names.** Renamed to `human-attestation` (parameterized) and `observable-period` respectively, to align with the new naming convention (primitive names describe the *operation*, not the *imperative*).

### Resolved (open design questions)

- **§10 Q5** — *Is circuit-breaker a primitive or a composed pattern?* **Resolved as a composed pattern.** Decomposes into `provenance-log` (signal source) + `policy-halt` (halt action).

### Partially addressed

- **§10 Q7** — *The `q̂` problem (perceived-risk dynamics).* Partially addressed in v0.2 by the combination of `uncertainty-declaration` (raises `q̂` from the agent side) and `drift-monitor` (raises `q̂` from the environment side). Remaining sub-question: should AWG enumerate canonical signals that should raise `q̂`, or leave signal selection to adopters? Carried forward to v0.3+.

### Added to the open-questions list

- **§10 Q8** — *Calibration boundary.* `uncertainty-declaration` requires the declaration but defers calibration to model risk. Is this delegation sound, or does AWG need to require evidence of calibration evaluation as part of `design-attestation`?

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-11

Initial skeleton draft. Establishes the framework's structure, principles, scope, and component skeleton. Multiple sections marked explicitly as v0.1-quality and pending structural review.

### Added

- **Origin section (§0).** Mechanism and motivation grounded in Wiles, Hsu, Bedard & Kropp (2026), *Putting AI on the Org Chart: Evidence on Delegation and Oversight* (Boston University / BCG working paper). AWG positioned as filling the agentic governance gap between model-risk frameworks (NIST AI RMF), management-system standards (ISO/IEC 42001), and regulatory compliance kits (EU AI Act).
- **Four load-bearing principles (§1).**
  - **P1** — Accountability is pinned to a human.
  - **P2** — Gates are structural substitutes for an absent moral-hazard reflex.
  - **P3** — Autonomy is earned per-tier, not granted globally.
  - **P4** — Cheap talk does not govern.
- **Agency-level scoping (§2).** Four-level taxonomy (L0–L3) distinguishing suggest-only systems (L0, out of AWG scope), approve-and-execute (L1), bounded autonomy (L2), and open autonomy (L3). Explicit statement that AWG applies only to L1+.
- **Work classification (§3).** Three-axis scoring (stakes / reversibility / blast radius) plus agency level, producing a GREEN / YELLOW / RED tier that drives gate intensity downstream.
- **Phase model (§4).** Five-phase model — Plan, Act, Verify, Release, Monitor — as the placement guide for gate primitives. Phase optionality is allowed; not every workflow exercises every phase.
- **Initial gate primitive library (§5).** Six primitives: `human-review-required`, `dual-control`, `dry-run-required`, `observable-period-required`, `rollback-rehearsed`, `circuit-breaker`. *(Restructured in v0.2; see the v0.2 entry above.)*
- **Handoff schema concept (§6).** Defined required content for `human-review-required` artifacts: Intent, Diff, Justification, Evidence, Reversibility, Open Questions. *(Extended in v0.2 with `Uncertainty` as a required field.)*
- **Accountability principle (§7).** Four normative requirements pinning workflow accountability to a named human Process Owner. Codifies that AI agent names do not appear on org charts; Process Owner names appear on workflow design documents.
- **AWG matrix (§8).** Tier × phase composition matrix specifying gate requirements per intersection.
- **Scope-boundary section (§9, "What AWG Is Not").** Explicit non-goals: not a model risk framework, not a regulatory compliance framework, not a security review process, not a checklist, not for L0 systems, not a substitute for engineering rigor.
- **Open design questions (§10).** Initial set of seven open questions deferred to subsequent versions: (1) data sensitivity as a fourth classification axis, (2) interaction with existing change management, (3) re-classification cadence, (4) tooling neutrality, (5) circuit-breaker classification, (6) multi-agent accountability, (7) the `q̂` problem.
- **Application guide (§11).** Six-step adopter walkthrough — locate, classify, map, compose, schema, pin.
- **Glossary (Appendix A).** Initial entries — *agent*, *Process Owner*, *governance function*, *gate*, *handoff*, *tier*.
- **References (Appendix B).** Wiles et al. (2026), NIST AI RMF 1.0, ISO/IEC 42001:2023, Aghion & Tirole (1997), Holmström (1979).

### Notes

- v0.1 self-identified the primitive list in §5 as the most likely structurally wrong component on first pass. The v0.2 rework confirmed and addressed this.
- v0.1's §8 matrix referenced primitive *names* rather than coordinates with parameters. Sharpened in v0.2.
